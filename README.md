# Movie App (Test)

A simple Android application that displays a list of movies using a TMDb API. It supports a favorites feature, loads data using Paging 3, and follows a modern MVI architecture with Koin.

---

## Architecture Decision

The **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern was used to clearly separate concerns and support testability, as follows:


> **Data Flow:**  
> Movie data is fetched from the API, then saved into the local Room database.
> The UI always displays data from Room. This approach ensures offline support and a smooth user experience.
> Paging 3 is integrated with Room to load data efficiently in pages.


## â–¶ How to Run the Project

1. Open the project using Android Studio  newer.
2. Make sure you are connected to the internet.
3. Click "Run" to start the app on an emulator or a real device.
